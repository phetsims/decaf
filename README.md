# Decaf

PhET maintains support for Java simulations through a commercial product called CheerpJ, which allows Java code to run
in an HTML5 page. This document outlines the process for building and deploying Java simulations.

## Install CheerpJ

1. This process has been tested with CheerpJ 2.1

## Set up SVN repo for Java development:

1. Download and install jdk1.7.0_80.jdk from Oracle
2. Check out the SVN truck branch named "decaf" (can be done in-place on an existing checkout).
    ```
    svn checkout https://phet.unfuddle.com/svn/phet_svn/branches/decaf ~/phet-svn-trunk-2020
    ```
3. Compile the phet java BuildScript *.class files.

```
cd build-tools/
chmod u+x ./contrib/apache-ant/bin/ant
```

4. Target the installed JDK by setting the `JAVA_HOME` env variable

```
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_80.jdk/Contents/Home/
./build.sh
```

5. At this point a PhET Build GUI will launch and can be closed.

These instructions assume cheerpjfy python script is located in `/Applications/cheerpj/cheerpjfy.py`. This instruction
set also assumes your `localhost` is running.

## Set up build-local.json

In `.phet/build-local.json` you will need to add these entries:

```
"gitRoot":"/path/to/git/root",
"decafTrunkPath": "path/to/trunk",
"decafTrunkOutputPath": "path/to/trunk/output",
"urlRoot": "localHostURL"
```

## Set up to run PhET Build GUI

For the following commands, use --debug if something is wrong

## Build

```
cd perennial
grunt build-decaf --project={{PROJECT}}
```

Test the build artifact from the url in the console.

Note: The first time the Build steps are run on macOS, you will need to grant security access for CheerpJ and some of
its utilities ( opt, llc, etc.). This can be done by going to Security and Privacy settings and allowing access from the
prompt under "Allow apps downloaded from: ".

## Deploy dev (outputs a script to deploy production)

The deploy step requires VPN.

```
cd ../decaf
git add *
git commit -m "Update version"
git push
cd ../perennial
grunt deploy-decaf --project={{PROJECT}} --dev --production
```

## Deploy production

Using your personal login credentials, run the script from the previous command, outputted
after `SERVER SCRIPT TO PROMOTE DEV VERSION TO PRODUCTION VERSION`
Test launching the sim from the sim page.

## Batch build and deploy

cd perennial ./bin/decaf-build-and-deploy.sh {{PROJECT}}

## Deploying new translations

```
cd ~/phet-svn-trunk-2020
svn info
svn switch ^/trunk
svn update
svn switch https://phet.unfuddle.com/svn/phet_svn/branches/decaf .
svn status
svn merge ^/trunk
```

Review and commit changes.

```
svn commit
```

If credentials are needed use: ``` svn commit --username --password```

Deploy following above instructions
